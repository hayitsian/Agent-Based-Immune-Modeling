a cell
- interacts with its immediate environment
- responds with proteins that traverse a gradient
- mutates over time
- can learn behavior to respond faster to recurring situations


how to do all the cell calculations in a loop and all the actions at the end?
- (done) calculate the probabilities beforehand
- loop through and calculate the action for each cell (randomize the order and freeze the gamestate)
	- do not actually perform the actions though
	- i.e. do not move, create, and remove any cells
- at the end, perform the actions
	- at once? not sure how that is possible
	- in a random order

issues I am seeing with immune cells:
- cells tend to aggregate along the diagonals in the late game
- when immune cells are alone, they appear to attack infected cells
	- but not always. 
- when together, then tend to not attack at all even if surrounded by 2+ infected cells
- immune cells tend to aggregate in the middle too
- towards the end game even though their reproduced and dead probabilities are almost the same, they outmatch healthy cells bc they cannot be infected
- the immune cells reproduce even when setting reproduce and die probabilities to zero?
	- the probability calculations may be mixing up cells
	- like a cell might die or reproduce, shifting everything in the wrong way
- the immune cells will stick next to infected cells but not do anything?

quality of life for faster iterations:
- make the input options command line arguments
- make runtime folder with an output log and a replayable video of the simulation
- make GUI for visual interactions with the gamestate
	- e.g. can hover an immune cell to view its visibility window

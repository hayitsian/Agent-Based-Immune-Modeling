plan for learnable immune agents (code):

- revamp the gamestate code to allow pluggable immune cell agents to directly compare
	- store all needed environemental information in the grid-cells
	- standardize the immune agent class
	- move all calculation functions to the immune agents
	- define some global utility
	- add functionality to measure train time and compute required, as well as error over time

- heuristic utility agent
	- develop math for each agent's local utility decisionmaking
	- grid search for parameters for utility function to meet desired functionality

- learnable agent
	- develop inputs and outputs of math function to do decisionmaking
	- develop reward function to learn from
	- implement and train to meet desired functionality

- ODE agent
	- develop simplistic ODE model for each immune cell
	- figure out how to implement differentials into the grid
	- implement ODEs
